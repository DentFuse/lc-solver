# LeetCode Solver

This is rudimentary script I made overnight to prove that LeetCode stats shouldn't be the only selection criteria  and people with low solutions counts shouldn't be disgraced.

I'm not promoting anyone to use this script to solve LeetCode questions for them, doing this defeat the purpose of LeetCode which is to learn DSA and not to increase the solution count. 

Though this script should work for the most part, the solution finding and parsing is a bit wonky and might not work for some questions. **I will not be fixing or updating this anymore.** This was a Proof of Concept and will remain as such.

To test/run it, use
`
node index.js [username] [password] [start count]
`
